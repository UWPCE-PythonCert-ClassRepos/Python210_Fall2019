"""
The Fibonacci Series is a numeric series starting with the integers 0 and 1.
In this series, the next integer is determined by summing the previous two
This gives us:
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...

We will write a function that computes this series â€“ then generalize it.

The Lucas Numbers are a related series of integers that start with the values 2 and 1 rather than 0 and 1. The resulting series looks like this:
2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, ...
