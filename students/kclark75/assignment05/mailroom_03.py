"""
The program part 1: write a small command-lind script.
This script should be executable. The script shoud accomplish the following
goals:
1. It should have a data structure that holds a list of your donors and a
    history of the amount they have donated. This structure should be populated
    at first with at least five donors, with between 1 and 3 donations each.
    You can store that data structure in the global namespase.
2. The script should prompt the user(you) to choose from a menu of 3 actions:
    "send a thank you", "create a report" or "quit".

Mailroom 2 - Update your mailroom program to:

Use dicts where appropriate.
See if you can use a dict to switch between the userâ€™s selections.
Done - Convert your main donor data structure to be a dict.
Try to use a dict and the .format() method to produce the
     letter as one big template, rather than building up a big string that
     produces the letter in parts.
